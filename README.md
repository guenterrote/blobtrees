# Blobtrees
Blob-trees are a way of connecting a set of points in the plane by a mixture of enclosing them by cycles (as in the convex hull) and   connecting them by edges (as in a spanning tree). The program computes a minimum-cost blob tree for n points in O(n^3) time.

In the default configuration, blobtree.py accepts a parameter n on the command-line, generates n random points in the unit square, and computes the optimum blobtree. Output is provided graphically as a file blobsol.ipe, while can be processed by 
Otfried Cheong's extensible drawing editor ipe, https://ipe.otfried.org/. In addition to the optimal solution, the result file shows the solutions of some selected subproblems.

The algorithm is described in the paper "Minimum spanning blob-trees" by Katharina Klost, Marc van Kreveld, Daniel Perz, GÃ¼nter Rote, and Josef Tkadlec.
